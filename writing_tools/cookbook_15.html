<P>
There are several ways to spell check text and files on Linux; the
following recipes show how to find the correct spellings of particular
words and how to perform batch, interactive, and Emacs-based spell
checks.


<P>
The system dictionary file, <TT>`/usr/dict/words'</TT>,<A NAME="DOCF18" HREF="cookbook_foot.html#FOOT18">(18)</A> is nothing more than a word
list (albeit a very large one), sorted in alphabetical order and
containing one word per line. Words that are correct regardless of case
are listed in lowercase letters, and words that rely on some form of
capitalization in order to be correct (such as proper nouns) appear in
that form. All of the Linux spelling tools use this text file to check
spelling; if a word does not appear in the dictionary file, it is
considered to be misspelled.


<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> None of the computerized spell-check tools will correct
your writing if you are using the wrong word to begin with -- for
example, if you have <SAMP>`there'</SAMP> when you mean <SAMP>`their'</SAMP>, the
computer will not catch it (yet!).

<H3><A NAME="SEC208" HREF="cookbook_toc.html#TOC208">Finding the Correct Spelling of a Word</A></H3>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX930"></A>
<A NAME="IDX931"></A>


<P>
If you're unsure whether or not you're using the correct spelling of a
word, use <CODE>spell</CODE> to find out. <CODE>spell</CODE> reads from the standard
input and outputs any words not found in the system dictionary -- so if a
word is misspelled, it will be echoed back on the screen after you type
it.



<UL>
<LI>

For example, to check whether the word <SAMP>`occurance'</SAMP> is misspelled, type:


<PRE>

<hr>
$ <I>spell [RET]
occurance [RET]</I>
occurance
<I>C-d</I>
$
<hr>

</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
In the example, <CODE>spell</CODE> echoed the word <SAMP>`occurance'</SAMP>, meaning
that this word was not in the system dictionary and therefore was quite
likely a misspelling. Then, <I>C-d</I> was typed to exit <CODE>spell</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC209" HREF="cookbook_toc.html#TOC209">Listing the Misspellings in a Text</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX932"></A>
<A NAME="IDX933"></A>
<A NAME="IDX934"></A>
<A NAME="IDX935"></A>
<A NAME="IDX936"></A>
<A NAME="IDX937"></A>


<P>
To output a list of misspelled words in a file, give the name of the
file to check as an argument to <CODE>spell</CODE>. Any misspelled words in
the file are output, each on a line of its own and in the order that
they appear in the file.



<UL>
<LI>

To spell check the file <TT>`fall-lecture.draft'</TT>, type:


<PRE>

<hr>
$ <I>spell fall-lecture.draft [RET]
occurance
willl
occurance</I>
$
<hr>

</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
In this example, three words are output: <SAMP>`occurance'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`willl'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`occurance'</SAMP> again, meaning that these three words were found in
<TT>`fall-lecture.draft'</TT>, in that order, and were not in the system
dictionary (and so were probably misspelled). Note that the misspelling
<SAMP>`occurance'</SAMP> appears twice in the file.


<P>
To correct the misspellings, you could then open the file in your
preferred text editor and edit it. Later in this section I'll describe
an interactive spell checker that allows you to correct misspellings as
they are found. Still another option is to use a text editor with
spell-checking facilities built in, such as Emacs.



<UL>
<LI>

To spell check the file <TT>`fall-lecture.draft'</TT>, and output any
possibly misspelled words to a file <TT>`fall-lecture.spelling'</TT>, type:


<PRE>
$ <I>spell fall-lecture.draft &#62; fall-lecture.spelling [RET]</I>
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
In this example, the standard output redirection character, <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP>, is
used to redirect the output to a file (see <A HREF="cookbook_5.html#SEC56">Redirecting Output to a File</A>).


<P>
To output an <EM>alphabetical</EM> list of the misspelled words, pipe the
output to <CODE>sort</CODE>; then pipe the sorted output to the <CODE>uniq</CODE>
filter to remove duplicates from the list (<CODE>uniq</CODE> removes duplicate
adjacent lines from its input, outputting the "unique" lines).



<UL>
<LI>

To output a sorted list of the misspelled words that are in the file
<TT>`fall-lecture.draft'</TT>, type:


<PRE>
$ <I>spell fall-lecture.draft | sort | uniq [RET]</I>
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
The stock American English dictionary installed with Linux-based systems
includes over 45,000 words. However large that number may seem, a lot of
words are invariably left out -- including slang, jargon, and some proper
names.


<P>
You can view the system dictionary as you would any other text file, but
users never edit this file to add words to it.<A NAME="DOCF19" HREF="cookbook_foot.html#FOOT19">(19)</A> Instead, you add new words to
your own <EM>personal dictionary</EM>, a file in the same format as the
system dictionary, but kept in your home directory as the file
<TT>`~/.ispell_default'</TT>.


<P>
Users can have their own personal dictionary; the spelling commands
discussed in this chapter automatically use your personal dictionary, if
you have one, in addition to the system dictionary.


<P>
You build your personal dictionary using the <I>i</I>
and <I>u</I> options of <CODE>ispell</CODE>, which insert words into your
personal dictionary. Use these options either with the stand-alone tool
or with the various <CODE>ispell</CODE> Emacs functions (see <A HREF="cookbook_15.html#SEC211">Interactive Spell Checking</A> and <A HREF="cookbook_15.html#SEC212">Spell Checking in Emacs</A>).


<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> You can also add (or remove) words by manually editing
the file with a text editor, but take care so that the list is kept in
alphabetical order!


<P>
Over time, personal dictionaries begin to look very personal, as a
reflection of their owners; Gregory Cosmo Haun made a work of art by
photographing the portraits of a dozen users superimposed with listings
of their personal dictionaries (accessible online at
<A HREF="http://www.reed.edu/~cosmo/art/DictPort.html">http://www.reed.edu/~cosmo/art/DictPort.html</A>).

<A NAME="IDX947"></A>


<P>
Use <CODE>ispell</CODE> to spell check a file <EM>interactively</EM>, so that
every time a misspelling is found, you're given a chance to replace it
then and there.



<UL>
<LI>

To interactively spell check <TT>`fall-lecture.notes'</TT>, type:


<PRE>
$ <I>ispell fall-lecture.notes [RET]</I>
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
When you type this, <CODE>ispell</CODE> begins checking the file. It stops at
the first misspelling it finds:



<hr>
<IMG SRC="grammar-ispell-01.jpg" ALT="grammar-ispell-01" WIDTH="483" HEIGHT="315"><hr>

<P>
On the top line of the screen, <CODE>ispell</CODE> displays the misspelled
word, followed by the name of the file. Underneath this is the sentence
in which the misspelling appears, with the word in question
highlighted. Following this is a list of suggested words, each offset by
a number -- in this example, <CODE>ispell</CODE> has only one suggestion:
<SAMP>`lectures'</SAMP>.


<P>
To replace a misspelling with a suggested word, type the number that
corresponds to the suggested word (in this example, you would type
<I>0</I> to replace the misspelling with <SAMP>`lectures'</SAMP>). You only need
to type the number of your selection -- a [RET] is not required.


<P>
You can also type a correction yourself; this is useful when
<CODE>ispell</CODE> either offers no suggestions, or when it does and the word
you want is not one of them. To do this, type <I>r</I> (for "replace")
and then type the replacement word, followed by [RET].


<P>
Sometimes, <CODE>ispell</CODE> will question a word that you may not want to
count as a misspelling, such as proper names and the like -- words that
don't appear in the system dictionary. There are a few things you can do
in such cases, as follows.


<P>
To accept a misspelled word as correct for the current <CODE>ispell</CODE>
session only, type <I>a</I>; from then on during the current session,
this word will be considered correct.


<P>
If, however, you want <CODE>ispell</CODE> (and <CODE>spell</CODE>, and all other
tools that access the system dictionary) to remember this word as being
correct for this and all future sessions, insert the word in your own
personal dictionary. Type <I>u</I> to insert a copy of the word
<EM>uncapitalized</EM>, in all lowercase letters -- this way, even if the
word is capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, the lowercase
version of the word is saved. From then on, in the current <CODE>ispell</CODE>
session and in future sessions, this word, regardless of case, will be
considered correct.


<P>
When case is important to the spelling -- for example, in a word that is
a proper name such as <SAMP>`Seattle'</SAMP>, or a word with mixed case, such as
<SAMP>`LaTeX'</SAMP>---type <I>i</I> to insert a copy of the word in your
personal dictionary with its case <EM>just as it appears</EM>; this way,
words spelled with the same letters but with different case will be
considered misspellings.


<P>
When <CODE>ispell</CODE> finishes spell checking a file, it saves its changes
to the file and then exits. It also makes a copy of the original file,
without the changes applied; this file has the same name as the original
but with <TT>`.bak'</TT> added to the end -- so in our example, the backup
file is called <TT>`fall-lecture.notes.bak'</TT>. This is useful if you
regret the changes you've made and want to restore the file to how it
was before you mucked it up -- just remove the spell-checked file and
then rename the <TT>`.bak'</TT> file to its original name.


<P>
The following table is a reference to the <CODE>ispell</CODE> key commands.


<TABLE border=0 cellpadding=4 align=center>

<P>
Emacs has several useful commands for spell checking. The
<CODE>ispell-word</CODE>, <CODE>ispell-region</CODE>, and <CODE>ispell-buffer</CODE>
functions, as you might guess from their names, use the <CODE>ispell</CODE>
command inside Emacs to check portions of the current buffer.


<P>
The first command, <CODE>ispell-word</CODE>, checks the spelling of the word
at point; if there is no word at point, it checks the first word to the
left of point. This command has a keyboard shortcut, <I>M-$</I>. The
second command, <CODE>ispell-region</CODE>, checks the spelling of all words
in the currently selected region of text. The third command,
<CODE>ispell-buffer</CODE>, checks the spelling of the entire buffer.



<UL>
<LI>

To check the spelling of the word at point, type:


<PRE>
<I>M-x ispell-word [RET]</I>
</PRE>

<LI>

To check the spelling of all words in the currently selected region of
text, type:


<PRE>
<I>M-x ispell-region [RET]</I>
</PRE>

<LI>

To check the spelling of all words in the current buffer, type:


<PRE>
<I>M-x ispell-buffer [RET]</I>
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
<CODE>Flyspell</CODE> mode is another useful Emacs spelling command that, when
set in a buffer, highlights misspelled words. This function is useful
when you are writing a first draft in a buffer, because it lets you
catch misspellings as you type them.



<UL>
<LI>

To turn on <CODE>Flyspell</CODE> mode in a buffer, type:


<PRE>
<I>M-x flyspell-mode [RET]</I>
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> This command is a toggle; run it again to turn it off.


<P>
To correct a word in <CODE>Flyspell</CODE> mode, click and release the middle
mouse button on the word to pull up a menu of suggestions; you then use
the mouse to select the replacement word or add it to your personal
dictionary.


<P>
If there are words you frequently misspell, you can define abbrevs for
them (see <A HREF="cookbook_14.html#SEC193">Making Abbreviations in Emacs</A>). Then, when you type the misspelled word, Emacs will
automatically replace it with the correct spelling.


<P>
Finally, if you prefer the sparse, non-interactive interface of
<CODE>spell</CODE>, you can use the Emacs interfaces to that command instead:
<CODE>Spell word</CODE>, <CODE>Spell region</CODE>, and <CODE>Spell buffer</CODE>. When
any of these commands find a misspelling, they prompt for a replacement
in the minibuffer but do not offer suggestions or provide any of
<CODE>ispell</CODE>'s other features.

The term <EM>dictionary</EM> on Linux systems generally refers to one of
two things: the traditional Unix-style dictionary, which is an
alphabetically sorted word list containing no actual definitions, and
the newer database-style dictionary that contains the headwords as well
as their definitions. The latter is the kind of thing most people mean
when they talk about dictionaries. (When most Unix folk talk about
dictionaries, however, they almost always mean the former.)


<P>
WordNet is a lexical reference system in the form of a database
containing thousands of words arranged in synonym sets. You can search
the database and output the results in text with the <CODE>wn</CODE> tool or
the <CODE>wnb</CODE> X client (the "WordNet browser").


<P>
Use of the X client is fairly straightforward -- type a word in the
dialog box near the top of the screen, followed by [RET], to get its
definition(s), which are displayed in the large output window underneath
the dialog box.


<P>
For example, this is what appears when you do a search for the
definition of the word <SAMP>`browse'</SAMP>:


<P>
<IMG SRC="grammar-wnb-01.jpg" ALT="grammar-wnb-01" WIDTH="602" HEIGHT="328">

<P>
Between the dialog box and the output window, there are menus for
searching for synonyms and other word senses. A separate menu is given
for each part of speech a word may have; in the preceding example, the
word <SAMP>`browse'</SAMP> can be either a noun or a verb, so two menus are
shown.


<P>
To get a list of all word sense information available for a given word,
run <CODE>wn</CODE> with the name of the word as an argument. This outputs a
list of all word sense information available for the word, with each
possible sense preceded with the name of the option to use to output it.



<UL>
<LI>

To output a list of word senses available for the word <SAMP>`browse'</SAMP>,
type:


<PRE>
$ <I>wn browse [RET]</I>
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
The following sections show how to use <CODE>wn</CODE> on the command line.


<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> For more information on WordNet, consult the

<P>
There are several ways to search for and output words from the system
dictionary.


<P>
Use <CODE>look</CODE> to output a list of words in the system dictionary that
begin with a given string -- this is useful for finding words that begin
with a particular phrase or prefix. Give the string as an argument; it
is not case sensitive.



<UL>
<LI>

To output a list of words from the dictionary that begin with the string
<SAMP>`homew'</SAMP>, type:


<PRE>
$ <I>look homew [RET]</I>
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
This command outputs words like <SAMP>`homeward'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`homework'</SAMP>.


<P>
Since the system dictionary is an ordinary text file, you can also use
<CODE>grep</CODE> to search it for words that match a given pattern or regular
expression (see <A HREF="cookbook_18.html#SEC263">Regular Expressions -- Matching Text Patterns</A>).



<UL>
<LI>

To list all words in the dictionary that contain the string <SAMP>`dont'</SAMP>,
regardless of case, type:


<PRE>
$ <I>grep -i dont /usr/dict/words [RET]</I>
</PRE>

<LI>

To list all words in the dictionary that end with <SAMP>`ing'</SAMP>, type:


<PRE>
$ <I>grep ing^ /usr/dict/words [RET]</I>
</PRE>

<LI>

To list all of the words that are composed only of vowels, type:


<PRE>
$ <I>grep -i '^[aeiou]*$' /usr/dict/words [RET]</I>
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
To find some words that rhyme with a given word, use <CODE>grep</CODE> to
search <TT>`/usr/dict/words'</TT> for words ending in the same last few
characters as the word they should rhyme with (see <A HREF="cookbook_18.html#SEC265">Matching Lines Ending with Certain Text</A>).



<UL>
<LI>

To output a list of words that rhyme with <SAMP>`friend'</SAMP>, search
<TT>`/usr/dict/words'</TT> for lines ending with <SAMP>`end'</SAMP>:


<PRE>
$ <I>grep 'end$' /usr/dict/words [RET]</I>
</PRE>

</UL>

Finally, to do a search on the WordNet dictionary, use <CODE>wn</CODE> with
one of the <SAMP>`-grep'</SAMP> options. When you give some text to search for

The DICT Development Group has a number of free dictionaries on their
Web site at <A HREF="http://www.dict.org/">http://www.dict.org/</A>. On that page, you can look up
the definitions of words (including thesaurus and other searches) from a
dictionary that contains over 300,000 headwords, or make a copy of their
dictionary for use on your own system. A <CODE>dict</CODE> client exists for
accessing DICT servers and outputting definitions locally; this tool is
available in the <TT>`dict'</TT> package.


<P>
DICT also has a number of specialized dictionaries that are plain text
files (including the author's <CITE>Free Journalism Dictionary</CITE>,
containing jargon and terms used in the journalism and publishing
professions). Their <CITE>FILE</CITE> project, <CITE>The Free Internet Lexicon
and Encyclopedia</CITE>, is an effort to build a free, open source collection
of modern-word, idiom, and jargon dictionaries. FILE is a volunteer
effort and depends on the support of scholars and lexicographers; the
DICT pages contain information on how to help contribute to this worthy
project.

<BR>
Two venerable Unix tools for checking writing have recently been made
available for Linux-based systems: <CODE>style</CODE> and <CODE>diction</CODE>.


<P>
Old-timers probably remember these names -- the originals came with AT&#38;T
UNIX as part of the much-loved "Writer's Workbench" (WWB) suite of
tools back in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<A NAME="DOCF20" HREF="cookbook_foot.html#FOOT20">(20)</A>


<P>
AT&#38;T "unbundled" the Writer's Workbench from their UNIX version 7
product, and as the many flavors of Unix blossomed over the years, these
tools were lost by the wayside -- eventually becoming the stuff of Unix
lore.


<P>
In 1997, Michael Haardt wrote new Linux versions of these tools from
scratch. They support both the English and German languages, and
they're now part of the GNU Project.


<P>
Two additional commands that were part of the Writer's Workbench have
long been standard on Linux: <CODE>look</CODE> and <CODE>spell</CODE>, described
previously in this chapter.

<P>
Use <CODE>diction</CODE> to check for wordy, trite, clich&eacute;d, or misused
phrases in a text. It checks for all the kind of expressions William
Strunk warned us about in his <A HREF="http://coba.shsu.edu/help/strunk/"><CITE>Elements of Style</CITE></A>.


<P>
According to <CITE>The UNIX Environment</CITE>, by Andrew Walker, the
<CODE>diction</CODE> tool that came with the old Writer's Workbench just
<EM>found</EM> the phrases, and a separate command called <CODE>suggest</CODE>
would output suggestions. In the GNU version that works for Linux
systems, both functions have been combined in the single <CODE>diction</CODE>
command.


<P>
In GNU <CODE>diction</CODE>, the words or phrases are enclosed in brackets
<SAMP>`[like this]'</SAMP>. If <CODE>diction</CODE> has any suggested replacements,
it gives them preceded by a right arrow, <SAMP>`-&#62; like this'</SAMP>.


<P>
When checking more than just a screenful of text, you'll want to pipe
the output to <CODE>less</CODE> so that you can peruse it on the screen
(see <A HREF="cookbook_13.html#SEC175">Perusing Text</A>), or pipe the output to a file
for later examination.

<P>
If you don't specify a file name, <CODE>diction</CODE> reads text from the

especially useful when you want to check a single sentence:

<P>
To check the text of a Web page, use the text-only Web browser
<CODE>lynx</CODE> with the <SAMP>`-dump'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-nolist'</SAMP> options to output
the plain text of a given URL, and pipe this output to <CODE>diction</CODE>.
(If you expect there to be a lot of output, add another pipe at the end
to <CODE>less</CODE> so you can peruse it.)
