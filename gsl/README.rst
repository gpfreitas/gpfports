./compile_gsl_multiarch.sh
    Script that I downloaded from the internet to build a universal binary for
    the mac. More info on the file.

./install_gsl_advanced.sh
    Script to build the GSL allowing for fine-grained control over the
    installation and compilation process. If you want shared libraries, use
    this script, or port features of this script to the basic one, and see
    notes in the section 'Issues' .

./install_gsl_basic.sh
    Simple script to build the GSL. Tries to do as much as possible
    automatically. If not install dir is supplied, it should install to
    /usr/local (ideally, so far, that feature is not implemented; so far, the
    install directory has to be specified in the script). No shared libraries
    are built.

Issues
======

BLAS
    I would like to be able to specify a BLAS implementation, like gotoBLAS,
    Apple's vecLib or Intel's MKL. So far, I don't know how to do that. 
    
Shared library
    I was also unable to obtain .so or .dylib shared libraries. I got these .la
    libtool files and I have no idea what to do with them. The output of the
    --configure command with --enable-shared is that Apple's compiler and
    linker do not support shared libraries. So maybe I need GNU's gcc to do
    this.

Authenticy of the source
    So far, the script does not check the authenticity of the source files.

Integrity of the source
    So far, the script does not check the integrity of the source files.

Bugs or Failures
    From the log file generated by 'make check' after compilation, the SVD
    routines are not reliable.
